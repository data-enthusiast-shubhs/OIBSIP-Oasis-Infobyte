# TASK 1 - EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
## Introduction
We've all experienced receiving spam emails, which can be annoying, time-consuming, and potentially dangerous. This project aims to address this issue by building an email spam detector using Python. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can train the spam detector to accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam.

## Features
Utilizes Python for building the email spam detector.
Applies machine learning algorithms for training and classification.
Implements label encoding to transform categorical data.
Uses Logistic Regression for the classification task.
Allows for custom prediction inputs.

## Installation
To run the email spam detector, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

* **Python 3.x**
* **numpy** 
* **pandas** 
* **scikit-learn**

# TASK 2 - UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON 
## Introduction
This repository contains a data science project aimed at analyzing the unemployment rate, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. Unemployment is an important economic indicator that measures the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labor force. By studying and understanding the trends and factors affecting unemployment, we can gain valuable insights into the job market and the broader economy.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the unemployment rate during the Covid-19 pandemic. The project will involve collecting relevant data, cleaning and preprocessing the data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Requirements
To run the notebooks and reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
* **Python (version 3.6 or higher)**
* **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**
* **Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,etc.)**

# TASK -3 Iris Flower Classification
This repository contains the code for training a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on their measurements. The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, each having distinct measurement characteristics. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify Iris flowers based on their measurements.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris flower dataset, which is commonly used for classification tasks. It includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 Iris flowers, with 50 samples for each species. The dataset is available in the repository as iris.csv.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

* **NumPy**
* **Pandas**
* **Seaborn**
* **Matplotlib**

## Model Training
The code for training the classification models can be found in the iris_classification.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. Three different models are trained:

* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
* **Logistic Regression**
* **Decision Tree Classifier**
* **Each model is trained using the Iris flower dataset and evaluated for its accuracy**

## Testing
After training the models, a new test dataset is used to assess their performance. The test dataset contains measurements of Iris flowers with unknown species. The trained models predict the species of these flowers, and their accuracy is evaluated.
