# TASK 1 - EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
## Introduction
We've all experienced receiving spam emails, which can be annoying, time-consuming, and potentially dangerous. This project aims to address this issue by building an email spam detector using Python. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can train the spam detector to accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam.

## Features
Utilizes Python for building the email spam detector.
Applies machine learning algorithms for training and classification.
Implements label encoding to transform categorical data.
Uses Logistic Regression for the classification task.
Allows for custom prediction inputs.

## Installation
To run the email spam detector, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

* **Python 3.x** \
* **numpy** \
* **pandas** \
* **scikit-learn**


# TASK 2 - UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON 
## Introduction
This repository contains a data science project aimed at analyzing the unemployment rate, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. Unemployment is an important economic indicator that measures the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labor force. By studying and understanding the trends and factors affecting unemployment, we can gain valuable insights into the job market and the broader economy.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the unemployment rate during the Covid-19 pandemic. The project will involve collecting relevant data, cleaning and preprocessing the data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Requirements
To run the notebooks and reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
* **Python (version 3.6 or higher)**
* **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**
* **Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,etc.)**
